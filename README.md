# Project0
Project0 is our attempt to making a game from scratch in C++ with OpenGL.
In our goal to learn a maximum about game engines we took "from scratch"
quite literally and decided to code our own renderer, physics engine and
sound engine.

### Sugar Renderer
Sugar Renderer is our own 2D render engine that uses OpenGL and GLM.

Features:
- Texture loading and rendering
- A simple light system

### Bubble Gum Physics
Bubble Gum Physics is our own 2D physics engine.

*WIP*

### Candy Sound
Candy Sound Physics is our own sound engine.

*WIP*
